# Multi-Layer Feature Circuits in Transformers

This repository hosts exploratory notebooks for studying feature circuits that emerge inside multi-layer transformer models. The initial Method_1.ipynb notebook reproduces the workflow used to inspect attention heads, visualize activations, and document findings from preliminary experiments.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have Python 3.10+ with JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook installed.
2. Clone this repository and install the Python dependencies required by your environment.
3. Launch Jupyter and open Method_1.ipynb to step through the analysis.
